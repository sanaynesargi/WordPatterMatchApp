*Live Demo coming soon!*

WordPatternMatch is a Wordle-style game that uses the basics of Worlde, but has an entirely different goal. WordPatternMatch chooses a random pattern and it is up to the user to guess words that match that same pattern.... with a *time limit* of **2 minutes!**

- The Number of Matches a user has to find may vary from day to day
- Words may be the same from day to day

## Features

- An entertaning game
- Adjusts for time zones
- New pattern every day
- Dark/Light Mode
- High Contrast Mode

## Technologies

Frameworks / Libraries:

- **Node JS** - A runtime JavaScript environment used for backend programming
- **React JS** - A fabulous frontend framwork used to build the beautiful UI

## How it works

WordPatternMatch is built with React for the frontend and with NodeJS for the backend.
Using these two wonderful tools, it is possible to create a seamless user experience as well
as creating an easy to play (but more importanly easy to devlop ðŸ˜‰) game. The inspiration for this project is here: https://github.com/cwackerfuss/react-wordle and thank you to github user *cwakerfuss* for the inspiration and help.
